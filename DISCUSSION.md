# GSoC Project Discussion

## Repository: [SNMP Poller](https://github.com/abbi4code/snmp_poller)

## Progress Summary - Past Two Weeks

### üöÄ What We've Accomplished

- **Network Simulation Setup**: Added ContainerLab integration and configured it to create virtual network topology for testing
- **Scalability Testing**: Successfully tested the prototype over 20 SNMP daemons in a simulated environment
- **Core Architecture Implementation**: Built a distributed SNMP polling system with the following components:
  - **Poller Module**: Asynchronous SNMP data collection from network devices
  - **Aggregator Module**: Data processing, aggregation, and storage functionality
  - **Configuration Management**: Flexible YAML-based configuration system
  - **Data Storage**: SQLite database integration for persistent storage
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Implemented ZeroMQ for efficient communication between poller and aggregator
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Used async/await patterns for high-performance SNMP operations
- **Device Management**: Dynamic device discovery and management system

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:
- **Data Collection Layer**: Handles SNMP requests to network devices
- **Processing Layer**: Aggregates and processes collected data
- **Storage Layer**: Persists data using asynchronous database operations
- **Configuration Layer**: Manages system and device configurations

### üìö Documentation

Complete project documentation has been added:
- **README.md**: Step-by-step installation guide with troubleshooting
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed technical documentation with system architecture diagram

### üîß Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- Basic SNMP polling functionality
- Asynchronous data collection
- Data aggregation and storage
- Network topology simulation
- Configuration management
- Documentation and setup guides

üîÑ **In Progress/Planned**:
- Enhanced data storage formats (blob storage for polled data)
- Zone-based configuration management
- CurveMQ and ZAP authentication for secure poller-aggregator communication
- Variable polling intervals for different metrics

## Upcoming Work - Week 3-4

### üéØ Planned Development Goals

- Continue working on prototype to implement mentioned improvements 
- Will work on the replacement of easysnmp with pysnmp with asyncio
